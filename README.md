This repo copies some code from my private repo.

## Projects ideas

- Calculate layout possibility using pad size of ICs or line lengths
- What I want to do is to get IC list from xpediton and count IC numbers in order to estimate power consumption of the board.
  - To do that, need to make data base of ICs which commonly used in RF projects.
- Accumulate problems we saw in the past. and put them into data base. and randomly display it like calender.
